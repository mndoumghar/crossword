# üß© Crossword Solver

This is a simple **Crossword Puzzle Solver** built in **JavaScript**. It takes a grid and a list of words, then uses **backtracking** to fill all valid positions in the crossword.


## üìå How it works

1. `parseMap(puzzle)`: Parses the input string into a 2D grid (`true` for available cell, `false` for blocked).
2. `findSlots(map)`: Finds horizontal and vertical slots that can hold words (length ‚â• 2).
3. `canPlace(grid, slot, word)`: Checks if a word fits into a slot without conflict.
4. `place(grid, slot, word)`: Inserts the word into the grid and keeps the original content for backtracking.
5. `remove(grid, slot, old)`: Undoes placement in case backtracking is needed.
6. `solve(grid, slots, words)`: Recursive backtracking function to solve the crossword.
7. `printGrid(grid)`: Converts the grid to a printable string with `.` for empty cells.

## üîÅ Algorithm: Backtracking

The solver tries to place each word in each slot recursively. If a word cannot lead to a full solution, it is removed (backtrack) and the next possibility is tested.
